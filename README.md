BlankNTP
==========

Chrome extension that makes the New Tab Page (NTP) open a blank page.

You can installed from the Chrome Webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blank-ntp/iadjchlpbbnbcofghllnmadckinmnaod
Or to load it manually following the Chrome developer instructions: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html

Based on extensions such as https://github.com/jimschubert/newtab-redirect, but much simpler (no configuration, no i18n etc) and no special permissions required.
